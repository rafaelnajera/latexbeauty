\chapter{Before Aristotle}

In this chapter I study the notion of \scientia\ in the 11\th\ and early 12\th\ centuries, before the translation of the works of Aristotle. The most important 
intellectual development in 
this time period is the rise of theology as a 
discipline that incorporates the intellectual tools of 
logic and dialectics. 
We can consider the publication and subsequent generalized adoption of the \worktitle{Sentences} of Peter Lombard in the 1150s as the culmination of this 
process. The first section describes this process mostly in historical terms, 
providing thus the background for the study in later sections of 
the actual 
philosophical content of texts by the main figures of the period: Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor.
